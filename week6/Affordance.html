  head
  {
    font-size: 32px;
  }

</style>

</head>

<body>
  <div class="good"></div>
    <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a><br>
    The link above looks like a link - it is blue and underlined. When clicked,
     it should take you to Yahoo.

  <div class="bad"></div>
    <font color="blue"><u>Google</u></font><br>
    The text above also looks like a link. However, when
    clicked, there is no functionality. This is a bad example of affordance,
    as the functionality is not intuitive/consistent with patterns seen before.
